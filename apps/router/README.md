# Role Access API

This application provides an API for managing and accessing roles, with view counting functionality. It uses Supabase for data storage, Redis for caching, and Supabase for view count tracking.

## Features

- Redirect to role URLs based on role ID
- View count tracking for each role
- Caching of ready roles in Redis
- Fetch all roles with their view counts

## Technologies Used

- Bun.js
- Elysia.js (for API routing)
- Supabase (main database)
- Redis (caching)

        J -->|No| L[Continue]
        K --> M[Reset count and timer]

    end

```

## API Endpoints

1. `GET /api/role-access`

   - Query params: `roleId`
   - Redirects to the role URL and increments view count
   - Returns view count in `X-View-Count` header

## Setup

1. Set the following environment variables:

   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `REDIS_URL`
   - `VERBOSE`

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   bun install
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```
   bun run index.ts
   ```

The server will start on port 5500 by default.

## Data Flow

1. Initialization:

   - On startup, the system fetches all ready roles from Supabase and stores them in Redis.

2. When a client requests a role access:

   - The system checks Redis for the role URL.
   - If found, it uses the URL from Redis.
   - If not found, it queries Supabase for the URL and then caches it in Redis.
   - The view count is incremented in memory and stored at Supabase when reaches 500 reqs or every 5 minutes (whicheer comes first).
   - The client is redirected to the role URL.

## Caching Strategy

- All ready roles are pre-fetched from Supabase and cached in Redis on startup.
- Role URLs are cached in Redis after the first access if not pre-cached.
- View counts are stored on memory and written as BATCH on Supabase.

This architecture ensures fast response times and reduces READ load on the Supabase database.
