## Introduction

The Email Sender feature is an integral part of the application, responsible for efficiently dispatching email messages to recipients. This documentation provides an in-depth overview of the feature's core components, functionality, and key concepts.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you should have the following installed on your system:

- Latest versions of Node.js
- Supabase libraries
- RabbitMQ

Refer to the official documentation for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
[Supabase](https://supabase.io/) and
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html) for installation guides.

## Functionality

- The emailSender function serves as the main orchestrator of the email sending process.
- It establishes a connection to the RabbitMQ channel for email consumption.
- A Resend instance is created, enabling email transmission using the Resend library.
- Email composer items are retrieved from the RabbitMQ queue for processing.
- Email composer items are divided into manageable chunks to optimize processing.
- For each chunk
  - sendEmail function is invoked to send individual emails.
  - Successful email deliveries are logged, and the corresponding emails are recorded as sent.
  - Failed email deliveries are logged, along with the affected emails, in the "failed-emails.txt" file.

  end
end
```

## Key Concepts

### Efficient Chunk Processing

Email sending is optimized by processing email composer items in manageable chunks. This approach ensures performance scalability and resource utilization.

### Reliable Logging

Detailed logging of email sending status enhances transparency and enables effective monitoring of successful and failed email deliveries.
