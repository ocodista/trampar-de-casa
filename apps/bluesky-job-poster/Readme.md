   git clone git@github.com:ocodista/trampar-de-casa.git
   cd trampar-de-casa

## Usage

yarn start
```

This will start the job posting process, which will:

1. Fetch job listings from Supabase
2. Process and format the job information
3. Post the jobs to Bluesky at regular intervals

## Docker

To build and run the application using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image using docker compose and run it:

   ```
   docker compose up --build
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/index.ts`: Main entry point of the application
- `docker-compose.yml`: Manage Dockerfile
- `Dockerfile`: Instructions for building the Docker image

## How It Works

1. The application logs into Bluesky using provided credentials.
2. It fetches job listings from the Supabase database.
3. Job listings are processed and formatted, including salary parsing.
4. The top 10 jobs (based on salary) are selected for posting.
5. Posts are created on Bluesky with job details and a tracking URL.
6. The process repeats at regular intervals to space out the posts.
